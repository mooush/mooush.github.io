              <p class="lead">Having spent our first year on the land living in a yurt at the bottom of the valley, surrounded by nature, we wanted to construct a more permanent structure to recreate the same feel without having to pack it up and store it whenever it wasn’t lived in. We decided to build with earth due to the very hot temperatures we had experienced in the peak of summer. The thermal mass of the thick earth walls acting as a buffer, levelling out the peaks and trofs of the climate here. It was important for us to use natural materials so that the dwelling would blend in well with its surroundings and provide a healthy environment to be in. Building with earth would allow the building to breath. Unlike conventional buildings, dwellings that breath allow moisture to travel through the building envelope and thereby avoid trapping humidity and damp inside the home.</p>
              <p class="lead">Cork insulation was used on the ceiling and reclaimed old clay leg tiles from Manel’s old barn were put on the roof. Expanded clay balls known as lecca were used as insulation for the floor, which is made from locally sourced pine.</p>
              <p class="lead">From an environmental perspective it was a must that the construction would be of very low impact. Our aim was to use materials with low embodied energy that needed minimal processing and transportation, minimising the Hut’s Co2 footprint. Using the earth and wood from our own land meant very little energy was spent on processing and transporting the main building materials. A complete Co2 Life cycle Assessment was made of The Hut as Annabel’s master's thesis (link to thesis).
